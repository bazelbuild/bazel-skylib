"""Creates a logical collection of Skylark .bzl files.

Args:
  srcs: List of `.bzl` files that are processed to create this target.
  deps: List of other `skylark_library` targets that are required by the
    Skylark files listed in `srcs`.

Example:
  Suppose your project has the following structure:

  ```
  [workspace]/
      WORKSPACE
      BUILD
      checkstyle/
          BUILD
          checkstyle.bzl
      lua/
          BUILD
          lua.bzl
          luarocks.bzl
  ```

  In this case, you can have `skylark_library` targets in `checkstyle/BUILD` and
  `lua/BUILD`:

  `checkstyle/BUILD`:

  ```python
  load("@bazel_skylib//:skylark_library.bzl", "skylark_library")

  skylark_library(
      name = "checkstyle-rules",
      srcs = ["checkstyle.bzl"],
  )
  ```

  `lua/BUILD`:

  ```python
  load("@bazel_skylib//:skylark_library.bzl", "skylark_library")

  skylark_library(
      name = "lua-rules",
      srcs = [
          "lua.bzl",
          "luarocks.bzl",
      ],
  )
  ```

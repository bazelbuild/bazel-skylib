# This package aids testing the 'copy_file' rule.
#
# The package contains 4 copy_file rules:
# - 'copy_src' and 'copy_gen' copy a source file and a generated file
#   respectively
# - 'copy_xsrc' and 'copy_xgen' copy a source file and a generated file
#   respectively (both are shell scripts), and mark their output as executable
#
# The generated file is the output of the 'gen' genrule.
#
# The 'bin_src' and 'bin_gen' rules are sh_binary rules. They use the
# 'copy_xsrc' and 'copy_xgen' rules respectively. The sh_binary rule requires
# its source to be executable, so building these two rules successfully means
# that 'copy_file' managed to make its output executable.
#
# The 'run_executables' genrule runs the 'bin_src' and 'bin_gen' binaries,
# partly to ensure they can be run, and partly so we can observe their output
# and assert the contents in the 'copy_file_tests' test.
#
# The 'file_deps' filegroup depends on 'copy_src'. The filegroup rule uses the
# DefaultInfo.files field from its dependencies. When we data-depend on the
# filegroup from 'copy_file_tests', we transitively data-depend on the
# DefaultInfo.files of the 'copy_src' rule.
#
# The 'copy_file_tests' test is the actual integration test. It data-depends
# on:
# - the 'run_executables' rule, to get the outputs of 'bin_src' and 'bin_gen'
# - the 'file_deps' rule, and by nature of using a filegroup, we get the files
#   from the DefaultInfo.files of the 'copy_file' rule, and thereby assert that
#   that field contains the output file of the rule
# - the 'copy_nonempty_text' rule, and thereby on the DefaultInfo.runfiles field
#   of it, so we assert that that field contains the output file of the rule

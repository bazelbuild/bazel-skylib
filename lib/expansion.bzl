    Recursively expands all values in `source_strings` using the given logic / lookup data.

    Note that the recursion performed is only among `resolution_dict` and

    `source_strings`).
    This function does not modify any of the given parameters.

    Args:
        wrapped_expand_location:    (Required) A function that takes in a string and properly
                                    replaces `$(location ...)` (and similar) with the corresponding
                                    values. This likely should correspond to
                                    `ctx.expand_location()` via `expansion.wrap_expand_location()`.
        resolution_dict:    (Required) A dictionary with resolved key/value pairs to be used for
                            lookup when resolving values. This may come from toolchains (via
                            `ctx.var`) or other sources.
        source_strings:     (Required) The source for all desired expansions. All values will
                            appear within the returned list, with all values fully expanded by the
                            logic expansion logic of `wrapped_expand_location` and by lookup in
                            `resolution_dict`.
        validate_expansion: (Optional) If set to True, all expanded strings will be validated to
                            ensure that no unexpanded (but seemingly expandable) values remain. If
                            any unexpanded values are found, `fail()` will be called. The
                            validation logic is the same as

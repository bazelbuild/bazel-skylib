    Each unit test is defined in an implementation function that must then be
    associated with a rule so that a target can be built. This function handles
    the boilerplate to create and return a test rule and captures the
    implementation function's name so that it can be printed in test feedback.

    The optional `attrs` argument can be used to define dependencies for this
    test, in order to form unit tests of rules.

    An example of a unit test:

    ```
    def _your_test(ctx):
      env = unittest.begin(ctx)

      # Assert statements go here

      return unittest.end(env)

    your_test = unittest.make(_your_test)

      attrs: An optional dictionary to supplement the attrs passed to the
          unit test's `rule()` constructor.

      `_test`.

    After defining your test rules in a `.bzl` file, you need to create targets
    from those rules so that `blaze test` can execute them. Doing this manually
    in a BUILD file would consist of listing each test in your `load` statement
    and then creating each target one by one. To reduce duplication, we recommend
    writing a macro in your `.bzl` file to instantiate all targets, and calling
    that macro from your BUILD file so you only have to load one symbol.

    For the case where your unit tests do not take any (non-default) attributes --
    i.e., if your unit tests do not test rules -- you can use this function to
    create the targets and wrap them in a single test_suite target. In your
    `.bzl` file, write:

    ```
    def your_test_suite():
      unittest.suite(
          "your_test_suite",
          your_test,
          your_other_test,
          yet_another_test,
      )
    ```

    Then, in your `BUILD` file, simply load the macro and invoke it to have all
    of the targets created:

    ```
    load("//path/to/your/package:tests.bzl", "your_test_suite")
    your_test_suite()
    ```

    If you pass _N_ unit test rules to `unittest.suite`, _N_ + 1 targets will be
    created: a `test_suite` target named `${name}` (where `${name}` is the name
    argument passed in here) and targets named `${name}_test_${i}`, where `${i}`
    is the index of the test in the `test_rules` list, which is used to uniquely
    name each target.

    Args:
      name: The name of the `test_suite` target, and the prefix of all the test
          target names.
      *test_rules: A list of test rules defines by `unittest.test`.

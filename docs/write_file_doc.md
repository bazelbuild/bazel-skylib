<!-- Generated with Stardoc: http://skydoc.bazel.build -->

A rule that writes a UTF-8 encoded text file from user-specified contents.

native.genrule() is sometimes used to create a text file. The 'write_file' and
macro does this with a simpler interface than genrule.

The rules generated by the macro do not use Bash or any other shell to write the
file. Instead they use Starlark's built-in file writing action
(ctx.actions.write).

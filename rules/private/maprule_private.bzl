{intro}

Maprule runs a specific command for each of the "foreach" source files. This allows processing
source files in parallel, to produce some outputs for each of them.

The name "maprule" indicates that this rule can be used to map source files to output files, and is
also a reference to "genrule" that inspired this rule's design (though there are significant
differences).

Below you will find an Example, Tips and Tricks, and an FAQ.

### Example

{example}

The "process_assets" rule above will execute the command in the `cmd` to process "rust.png",
"teapot.3ds", "//assets:wood.jpg", and every file in the "//assets:models" rule, producing the
corresponding .tags and .md5 files for each of them, under the following paths:

    bazel-bin/projects/game/process_assets_out/projects/game/rust.png.tags
    bazel-bin/projects/game/process_assets_out/digests/rust.md5
    bazel-bin/projects/game/process_assets_out/projects/game/teapot.3ds.tags
    bazel-bin/projects/game/process_assets_out/digests/teapot.md5
    bazel-bin/projects/game/process_assets_out/assets/wood.jpg.tags
    bazel-bin/projects/game/process_assets_out/digests/wood.md5
    ...

You can create downstream rules, for example a filegroup or genrule (or another maprule) that put
this rule in their `srcs` attribute and get all the .tags and .md5 files.

## Tips and Tricks

*(The Tips and Tricks section is the same for `cmd_maprule` and `bash_maprule`.)*

### Use script files instead of inlining commands in the `cmd` attribute.

Unless the command is trivial, don't try to write it in `cmd`.

Properly quoting parts of the command is challenging enough, add to that escaping for the BUILD
file's syntax and the `cmd` attribute quickly gets unmaintainably complex.

It's a lot easier and maintainable to create a script file such as "foo.sh" in `bash_maprule` or
"foo.bat" in `cmd_maprule` for the commands. To do that:

1. move the commands to a script file
2. add the script file to the `tools` attribute
3. add an entry to the `add_env` attribute, e.g. "`TOOL:&nbsp;"$(location :tool.sh)"`"
4. replace the `cmd` with just "$MAPRULE_FOO" (in `bash_maprule`) or "%MAPRULE_FOO%" (in
   `cmd_maprule`).

Doing this also avoids hitting command line length limits.

Example:

    cmd_maprule(
        ...
        srcs = ["//data:temperatures.txt"],
        tools = [
            "command.bat",
            ":weather-stats",
        ],
        add_env = {{
            "COMMAND": "$(location :command.bat)",
            "STATS_TOOL": "$(location :weather-stats-computer)",
            "TEMPERATURES": "$(location //data:temperatures.txt)",
        }},
        cmd = "%MAPRULE_COMMAND%",
    )

### Use the `add_env` attribute to pass tool locations to the command.

Entries in the `add_env` attribute may use "$(location)" references and may also use the same
placeholders as the `outs_templates` attribute. For example you can use this mechanism to pass extra
"$(location)" references of `tools` or `srcs` to the actions.

Example:

    cmd_maprule(
        ...
        foreach_srcs = [...],
        outs_templates = {{"STATS_OUT": "{{src}}-stats.txt"}},
        srcs = ["//data:temperatures.txt"],
        tools = [":weather-stats"],
        add_env = {{
            "STATS_TOOL": "$(location :weather-stats-computer)",
            "TEMPERATURES": "$(location //data:temperatures.txt)",
        }},
        cmd = "%MAPRULE_STATS_TOOL% --src=%MAPRULE_SRC% --data=%MAPRULE_TEMPERATURES% > %MAPRULE_STATS_OUT%",
    )

    cc_binary(
        name = "weather-stats",
        ...
    )

## Environment Variables

*(The Environment Variables section is the same for `cmd_maprule` and `bash_maprule`.)*

The rule defines several environment variables available to the command may reference. All of these
envvars names start with "MAPRULE_". You can add your own envvars with the `add_env` attribute.

The command can use some envvars, all named "MAPRULE_*&lt;something&gt;*".

The complete list of environment variables is:

-   "MAPRULE_SRC": the path of the current file from `foreach_srcs`
-   "MAPRULE_SRCS": the space-separated paths of all files in the `srcs` attribute
-   "MAPRULE_*&lt;OUT&gt;*": for each key name *&lt;OUT&gt;* in the `outs_templates` attribute, this
    is the path of the respective output file for the current source
-   "MAPRULE_*&lt;ENV&gt;*": for each key name *&lt;ENV&gt;* in the `add_env` attribute

## FAQ

*(The FAQ section is the same for `cmd_maprule` and `bash_maprule`.)*

### What's the motivation for maprule? What's wrong with genrule?

genrule creates a single action for all of its inputs. It requires specifying all output files.
Finally, it can only create Bash commands.

Maprule supports parallel processing of its inputs and doesn't require specifying all outputs, just
templates for the outputs. And not only Bash is supported (via `bash_maprule`) but so are
cmd.exe-style commands via `cmd_maprule`.

### `genrule.cmd` supports "$(location)" expressions, how come `*_maprule.cmd` doesn't?

Maprule deliberately omits support for this feature to avoid pitfalls with quoting and escaping, and
potential issues with paths containing spaces. Instead, maprule exports environment variables for
the input and outputs of the action, and allows the user to define extra envvars. These extra
envvars do support "$(location)" expressions, so you can pass paths of labels in `srcs` and `tools`.

### Why are all envvars exported with the "MAPRULE_" prefix?

To avoid conflicts with other envvars, whose names could also be attractive outs_templates names.

### Why do `outs_templates` and `add_env` keys have to be uppercase?

Because they are exported as all-uppercase envvars, so requiring that they be declared as uppercase
gives a visual cue of that. It also avoids clashes resulting from mixed lower-upper-case names like
"foo" and "Foo".

### Why don't `outs_templates` and `add_env` keys have to start with "MAPRULE_" even though they are exported as such?

For convenience. It seems to bring no benefit to have the user always type "MAPRULE_" in front of
the name when the rule itself could as well add it.

### Why are all outputs relative to "*&lt;maprule_pkg&gt;*/*&lt;maprule_name&gt;*_out/" ?

To ensure that maprules in the same package and with the same outs_templates produce distinct output
files.

### Why aren't `outs_templates` keys available as placeholders in the values of `add_env`?

Because `add_env` is meant to be used for passing extra "$(location)" information to the action, and
the output paths are already available as envvars for the action.
